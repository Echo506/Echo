# 📋 **Note:**

This marks my **first approach to Chinese**, and to familiarize myself with the sounds and words, I've initially started with basic YouTube videos. I will list the channels in the references section for anyone interested in checking them out. Subsequently, I'll be sharing more resources and details about my learning process. 🇨🇳📚✨
